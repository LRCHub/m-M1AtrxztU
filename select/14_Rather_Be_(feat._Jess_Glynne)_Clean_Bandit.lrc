[00:08.63] Oh, oh, oh
[00:13.63] 
[00:16.06] We're a thousand miles from comfort
[00:20.15] We have travelled land and sea
[00:23.95] But as long as you are with me
[00:27.80] There's no place I'd rather be
[00:42.80] 
[00:32.26] I would wait forever
[00:36.31] Exalted in the scene
[00:40.29] As long as I am with you
[00:44.06] My heart continues to beat
[00:57.06] 
[00:48.28] With every step we take
[00:50.67] Kyoto to The Bay
[00:52.32] Strolling so casually
[00:56.12] We're different and the same
[00:58.57] Gave you another name
[01:00.26] Switch up the batteries
[01:11.76] 
[01:04.34] If you gave me a chance I would take it
[01:08.16] It's a shot in the dark but I'll make it
[01:12.22] Know with all of your heart, you can't shame me
[01:16.26] When I am with you, there's no place I'd rather be
[01:20.28] No, no, no, no, no, no place I'd rather be
[01:24.36] No, no, no, no, no, no place I'd rather be
[01:28.35] No, no, no, no, no, no place I'd rather be
[01:32.23] Ooh
[01:33.73] 
[01:35.84] We set out on a mission
[01:39.70] To find our inner peace
[01:43.78] Make it everlasting
[01:47.64] So nothing's incomplete
[01:59.14] 
[01:51.49] It's easy being with you
[01:55.33] Sacred simplicity
[01:59.18] As long as we're together
[02:03.21] There's no place I'd rather be
[02:18.21] 
[02:07.66] With every step we take
[02:09.95] Kyoto to The Bay
[02:11.56] Strolling so casually
[02:15.72] We're different and the same
[02:17.55] Gave you another name
[02:19.44] Switch up the batteries
[02:30.94] 
[02:23.42] If you gave me a chance I would take it
[02:27.65] It's a shot in the dark but I'll make it
[02:31.50] Know with all of your heart, you can't shame me
[02:35.50] When I am with you, there's no place I'd rather be
[02:39.61] No, no, no, no, no, no place I'd rather be
[02:43.63] No, no, no, no, no, no place I'd rather be
[02:47.63] No, no, no, no, no, no place I'd rather be
[02:51.39] When I am with you, there's no place I'd rather be, yeah
[03:19.39] 
[02:58.18] Be
[03:00.67] Ooh
[03:03.05] Be, be, be, be, be, be, be, be, be
[03:07.20] Yeah-e-yeah-e-yeah-e-yeah-e-yeah, yeah!
[03:26.70] 
[03:11.03] If you gave me a chance I would take it
[03:15.14] It's a shot in the dark but I'll make it
[03:18.96] Know with all of your heart, you can't shame me
[03:23.19] When I am with you, there's no place I'd rather be
[03:27.38] No, no, no, no, no, no place I'd rather be
[03:31.20] No, no, no, no, no, no place I'd rather be
[03:35.29] No, no, no, no, no, no place I'd rather be
[03:38.96] When I am with you there's no place I'd rather be
