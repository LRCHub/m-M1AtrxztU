We're a thousand miles
from comfort,
We have travelled land and sea,
But as long as you are with me,
There's no place I'd rather be.
I would wait forever,
Exalted in the scene,
As long as I am with you,
My heart continues to beat.
With every step we take,
Kyoto to the bay,
Strolling so casually,
We're different and the same
Get you another name
Switch up the battery
If you gave me a chance
I would take it
It's a shot in the dark
But I'll make it
Know with all of your heart
You can't shake me
When I am with you
There's no place I'd rather be.
No no no no no
No place I'd rather be
No no no no no
No place I'd rather be
No no no no no
No place I'd rather be
We set out on a mission
To find our inner peace
Make it everlasting
So nothing's incomplete
It's easy being with you,
Sacred simplictiy.
As long as we're together,
There's no place I'd rather be
With every step we take,
Kyoto to the bay,
Strolling so casually,
We're different and the same
Get you another name
Switch up the battery
If you gave me a chance
I would take it
It's a shot in the dark
But I'll make it
Know with all of your heart
You can't shake me
When I am with you
There's no place I'd rather be.
No no no no no
No place I'd rather be
No no no no no
No place I'd rather be
No no no no no
No place I'd rather be
When I am with you
There's no place I'd rather be

No no no no no
No place I'd rather be
No no no no no
No place I'd rather be
